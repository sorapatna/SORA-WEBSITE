# **Q-Signals**


## **Communicating with Other Hams(Contact Basics: Good Amateur Practices)**

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**
### **Q-signals are a system of radio shorthand as old as wireless and developed from even older telegraphy codes. Q-signals are a set of abbreviations for common information that save time and allow communication between operators who don’t speak a common language. Modern ham radio uses them extensively.The table below lists the most common Q-signals used by hams.While Q-signals were developed for use by Morse operators, their use is common on phone, as well.You will often hear, “QRZed?” as someone asks “Who is calling me?” or “I’m getting a little QRM” from an operator receiving some interference or “Let’s QSY to 146.55” as two operators change from a repeater frequency to a nearby simplex communications frequency.**
